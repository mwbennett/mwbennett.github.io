          <p>Let's talk about local storage, session storage, and cookies. These are all storage solutions held on the browser often used in client-side authentication methods. Learning the differences between these can help us better understand how sites always remember who we are when we leave and then return, and how the location of client-side data (especially authentication data) impacts user experience. </p>

<h5 id="localandsessionstoragemostlythesameonekeydifference">Local and session storage: mostly the same, one key difference</h5>

<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage">Local storage</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage">session storage</a> are both relatively new APIs that allow access to a local storage object on the browser. The scope for accessing data in both local and session storage is specifc to the <strong>origin</strong>, which refers to the unique combination of protocol, hostname, and port number. This means the data held in local storage is available on pages that were loaded from the same origin that stored the data previously. This same-origin policy protects against cross-site scripting (XSS) and other security risks. </p>

<p>The main difference between local and session storage is the <strong>persistence</strong> of the stored data. Data in local storage persists after a browser tab is closed, whereas data held in session storage is limited to the lifetime of a given browser tab. Data stored in either local or session storage will persist after page reloads. </p>

<h5 id="cookiesoldhabitsdiehard">Cookies: old habits die hard</h5>

<p>Unlike local and session storage, cookies travel between the browser and the server in the headers of every HTTP request. Cookies have been used to help a website keep track of stateful information, recent browsing activity, or authentication data. Unlike local and session storage, which can store multiple primitive data types, cookies can only store strings, meaning the data must be parsed on each request as well. </p>

<p>These days, some believe using cookies as a client-side storage mechanism is an artifact created by limitations that no longer exist (see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies</a>). Sending any data back and forth from the server introduces additional performance burden, and now that there are alternative storage options (see above!!), cookies could be relegated to a secondary storage method.  </p>

<h4 id="theresmore">There's more</h4>

<p>Much more could be said about the distinctions here (cookies are limited to 4KB in size, whereas local and session storage can manage 5MB or more, depending on the browser, e.g.), but the main takeaway is that these three storage options have different merits and drawbacks to be considered when choosing one over the other.</p>
