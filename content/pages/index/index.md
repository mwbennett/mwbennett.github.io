### Software engineer, drummer, basketball nerd, Oakland native.

Hey there! I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at [Samsara](https://samsara.com), a fleet management and industrial IoT company based in San Francisco.

Before returning to the Bay Area, I did stints in Connecticut, New York City, and most recently Detroit. Some previous escapades:

- Software development at [Waymark](https://waymark.com).
- 2015 [Venture for America](https://ventureforamerica.org) Fellow.
- Civic sector management consulting at [Bennett Midland](https://bennettmidland.com).
- Math and music at [Wesleyan University](https://wesleyan.edu).

Feel free to reach out.
