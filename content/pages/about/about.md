## About Mark

I'm a full stack developer, drummer, basketball nerd, Oakland native. I recently moved back to Oakland after being away for nearly a decade, spending chunks of time in Connecticut, New York City, and most recently Detroit. If you've never been to Detroit -- go! I'll happily offer a long list of recommendations and must-dos.

I'm currently a software developer at [Waymark](https://waymark.com), on an amazing Detroit-based team that's making high-quality video advertising accessible to all businesses. At present, I'm the lone member of our Bay Area office ðŸ™‚.

Past escapades:
- Math and music at [Wesleyan](https://wesleyan.edu)
- Consulting at [Bennett Midland](https://bennettmidland.com)
- Software engineering at [Hack Reactor](https://hackreactor.com)
- [Venture for America](https://ventureforamerica.org) fellow

This site is where I write, track, and show some of the things I'm interested in and working on. Poke around, read, and if you like, [drop me a line](mailto:bennettwmark@gmail.com).
