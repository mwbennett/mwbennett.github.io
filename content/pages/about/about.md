## About Me

I'm a full-stack software engineer, drummer, basketball nerd, backpacker and hiker, Oakland native. I recently moved back to Oakland after being away for nearly a decade, spending chunks of time in Connecticut, New York City, and most recently Detroit. If you've never been to Detroit -- go! I'll happily offer a long list of recommendations and must-dos.

Current and past escapades:
- Software development at [Waymark](https://waymark.com) [current]
- 2015 [Venture for America](https://ventureforamerica.org) Fellow
- Software engineering at [Hack Reactor](https://hackreactor.com)
- Civic sector management consulting at [Bennett Midland](https://bennettmidland.com)
- Math and music at [Wesleyan University](https://wesleyan.edu)

This is where I write about, track, and show the things I'm interested in and working on. Poke around, read, and if you like, [drop me a line](mailto:bennettwmark@gmail.com).
