    <p></p><p>Scopes and hoisting were two concepts I struggled with when I first began learning JavaScript. These are relatively simple concepts in retrospect, but I found they would continually trip me up and cost me time as I worked through sprints. So what are they? </p>

<h3 id="scopes">Scopes</h3>

<p>Variable scopes are portions of a program where the binding between a variable and a value is valid. Put another way, scopes determine which variables you have access to at any particular point in your code. In JavaScript, functions (and only functions) each create their own variable scope. </p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">var outerScope = function(){          // creates a new scope  
  var outer = 1;
  // code here can access 'outer'
  var innerScope = function(){        // creates another new scope 
    var inner = 2;
    if (inner){                       // does NOT create a new scope 
      var greeting = "hello";
    }
    // code here can access 'outer', 'inner', and 'greeting'
    console.log(greeting);            // logs "hello" 
  };
  // code here CANNOT access 'inner' or 'greeting'
};
// code here CANNOT access 'outer', 'inner', or 'greeting'
</code></pre>

<p>When a variable is referenced within a program, JavaScript will first check the current (local) scope for the assignment for that variable. If the variable is not assigned in the local scope, it will check the next containing scope for the variable, and will continue to look in outer scopes until either (a) the variable assignment is found, or (b) the final (global) scope cannot find the variable assignment, in which case the program will throw an error.  </p>

<h3 id="hoisting">Hoisting</h3>

<p>Hoisting is pretty simple: at run time, all function and variable declarations are hoisted to the top of their local scopes. Items are hoisted in the same order that they appear, except that within each scope, all function declarations are hoisted above variable declarations. A simple example will be the best way to demonstrate what this means, so check out the code below.  </p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">var petName = function(){  
  var name = "Bessie";
  var lastName = function(){
    var sentence = name + " is my name."
    var name = "Paul";
    return sentence;
  };
  return lastName();
};
</code></pre>

<p>It's not unreasonable to expect that <code>petName</code> would return "Bessie is my name." But it doesn't. To see why, let's check out how the code looks to the interpreter after variable hoisting occurs:  </p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">var petName;                  // petName declaration is hoisted  
petName = function(){  
  var name;                   // name declaration is hoisted 
  var lastName;               // lastName declaration is hoisted  
  name = "Bessie";           
  lastName = function(){     
    var sentence;             // sentence declaration is hoisted 
    var name;                 // name declaration is hoisted 
    sentence = name + " is my name.";  
    name = "Paul";            
    return sentence; 
  };
  return lastName();
};
</code></pre>

<p>And herein lies the problem. Rather than retaining the value assigned to <code>name</code> in the outer scope until it gets reassigned, variable hoisting moves the declaration for <code>name</code> to the top of the internal <code>lastName</code> scope. So when <code>sentence</code> is assigned, <code>name</code> has been declared in the internal scope, but not yet assigned. End result: as written, <code>lastName</code> will return "undefined is my name."  </p>

<h3 id="avoidingsnags">Avoiding snags</h3>

<p>A couple ways I've learned to avoid making silly mistakes involving scopes and hoisting:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Declare variables at the top of their respective scopes.</strong> Basically, I do the variable hoisting myself. This is ugly, and probably not recommended, but it's an easy way to see the code the way the interpreter will read it. </li>
<li><strong>Include all function dependencies as inputs.</strong> When I write functions that rely on variables that are declared in outer scopes, it quickly becomes challenging to keep track of where variables are originating. Instead, I include those variables as function inputs.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Eventually, I hope to be able to steer clear of issues related to these concepts without much conscious thought. Until then, these two practices have helped me avoid needless debugging.  </p>

  <section class="post-content">
    <p></p><p>I've officially arrived in the trenches at <a href="http://www.hackreactor.com">Hack Reactor</a>! My first few days here have been a complete blur, in the best possible way. Despite my having impossibly high expectations coming into the program, thus far Hack Reactor has completely lived up to the hype. </p>

<p>Hack Reactor strongly encourages students to maintain a blog during their time here, a suggestion that I have decided to follow despite my mild hatred for writing. Ultimately, I expect the value of blogging will outweigh the <em>certain</em> discomfort I will experience by publicly publishing written words on a regular basis. (If you're struggling to understand why this is such a big deal, it may be helpful to know that I typed, deleted, and retyped various versions of this sentence six times before ultimately moving on. TL;DR: writing is hard.)</p>

<h3 id="whyblog">Why blog?</h3>

<p>I know a few people who really love the saying "writing is thinking." As I already mentioned, I'm not wild about writing, and I'd hate to think that necessarily indicates an aversion to thinking too. So I'm inclined to believe that  we <em>are</em> able to think without writing, whereas it's nearly impossible to write clearly without thinking. </p>

<p>With that in mind, my reasoning for blogging is pretty simple - I see it as a way to force myself to engage with my own thoughts and understanding. Should they ever get read by others, I expect these entries will also help correct misunderstandings.</p>

<h3 id="posttopics">Post topics</h3>

<p>Who knows what I'll actually end up writing about, but here are some angles through which I expect to approach posts over the next 13 weeks: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Confirm understanding of technical concepts.</strong> I'll attempt to share interesting details or intricacies of a particular language or framework as I learn them. I doubt the content of these particular posts will be highly novel, but maybe that's the <a href="https://medium.com/@aliciatweet/overcoming-impostor-syndrome-bdae04e46ec5">impostor syndrome</a> talking. </li>
<li><strong>Convey my Hack Reactor experience.</strong> At this point, there are <a href="http://kevinhamiltonsmith.com/hack-reactor-student-blogs/">tons of blogs</a> that document the experiences of Hack Reactor students (and <a href="http://blog.thejsj.com/">many</a>, <a href="http://www.austentalbot.com/">many</a>, <a href="http://tylermcginnis.com/category/hack-reactor/">many</a> more since that post was published). I skimmed over more than a few of these before applying to the program, and the quality of the blogs was one of the many indications that Hack Reactor was the real deal. I feel it's only fair that I attempt to follow in the footsteps of providing useful insights for future Hack Reactor applicants and students. </li>
<li><strong>Share resources and solutions for potentially unique problems.</strong> It's likely that ~95% of my time over the next 13 weeks will be spent trying to solve broken code. I expect that on occasion, my code might be broken in a somewhat interesting way. When this happens, I figure it's a good excuse for a post—both to share a solution to a problem others might experience, and to ensure I fully understand the solution that I've implemented (back to the old "writing is thinking" argument). </li>
<li><strong>Articulate non-technical growth.</strong> Hack Reactor will help me become an exponentially better software engineer than I am now. It will also, I hope, help me grow in ways that aren't explicitly related to my technical abilities. I hope to occasionally reflect on that development as well. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bloggingscheduleandconventions">Blogging schedule and conventions</h3>

<p>(Before I go on, please know that I firmly believe nobody else in the world cares about my blogging schedule. That said, making a written commitment to post consistently will help create the illusion of external expectations, which might be enough to trick me into sticking with it.)</p>

<p>My initial goal is to blog three times per week. Each week, I'll aim to cover one technical topic, one topic that relates to Hack Reactor (directly or indirectly), and one wild card topic. (Yes, these categories aren't at all mutually exclusive...I'm setting expectations without actually committing to anything!) </p>

<p>Throughout my time at Hack Reactor, I'll be prefixing all my posts with "HR W#D#" to indicate how far into the program I am when writing. Today, for example, is Hack Reactor week 1, day 4—or HR W1D4—as seen at the top of this post. For reference, the course runs six days a week, for thirteen weeks.</p>

<p>I'll close with my first endorsement of an awesome tool. All my posts will include a comments section thanks to <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>. Should anyone happen to stumble across a post, please feel free to comment. You can do so without an account, but you should probably just sign up. <a href="https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/1109643-new-profiles-f-a-q-">Disqus profiles</a> are pretty great. </p>
